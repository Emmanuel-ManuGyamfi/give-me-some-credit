# Give Me Some Credit ‚Äî Probability of Default Model

This project builds a **credit risk scoring model** to predict the likelihood that a borrower will experience **financial distress within the next two years**.  
It is based on the [Kaggle "Give Me Some Credit"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit) competition dataset and demonstrates **end-to-end data science workflow** from data cleaning and feature engineering to model tuning and evaluation.

---

## Project Objectives
- Develop a **probability-of-default (PD)** model using credit data.  
- Apply **feature engineering** (handling outliers, imputations, data errors, and scaling).  
- Compare algorithms and select the champion model.  
- Communicate results effectively to **business stakeholders**.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment:** Conda / venv  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, Kaggle

## üí° Business Impact

This model allows financial institutions to:
- **Screen applicants** more accurately for credit risk  
- **Reduce bad debt rates** by targeting interventions  
- **Support fair lending** through interpretable variables  
- Simulate business impact:  
  > For every **100,000 applicants**, improved screening accuracy could reduce bad loans by ~8‚Äì10%, saving millions annually.

## üß† Learnings & Next Steps
- Handling class imbalance effectively using `scale_pos_weight` and proper thresholds.  
- Feature importance analysis to ensure fairness and interpretability.  
- Future work:  
  - Calibrated probability outputs  
  - SHAP-based interpretability  
  - Monitoring drift in production.
