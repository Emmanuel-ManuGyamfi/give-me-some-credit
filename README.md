# Give Me Some Credit ‚Äî Probability of Default Model

This project builds a **credit risk scoring model** to predict the likelihood that a borrower will experience **financial distress within the next two years**.  
It is based on the [Kaggle "Give Me Some Credit"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit) competition dataset and demonstrates **end-to-end data science workflow** from data cleaning and feature engineering to model tuning and evaluation.

---

## Project Objectives
- Develop a **probability-of-default (PD)** model using credit data.  
- Apply **feature engineering** (handling outliers, imputations, data errors, and scaling).  
- Compare algorithms and select the champion model.  
- Communicate results effectively to **business stakeholders**.

## Data Preparation

- **Outlier Capping:**  
  - `DebtRatio` capped at 5  
  - `RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines` capped at 2 
  - `NumberOfTime30-59DaysPastDueNotWorse` capped at 6
  - `NumberOfTime60-89DaysPastDueNotWorse` capped at 6
  - `NumberOfTimes90DaysLate` capped at 6
  - `NumberOfDependents` capped at 5
  - `NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans` capped at 30
  - `NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines` capped at 5
- **Imputations:**  
  - Replaced implausible values (e.g., over 100 years) with the median age of valid applicants (18‚Äì100) 
  - Extreme monthly incomes imputed with mean of high earners

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section highlights the main risk signals in the *Give Me Some Credit* dataset and motivates the engineered features used in the model.

#### Key takeaways
- **Severe class imbalance:** Only ~6.7% default ‚Üí accuracy alone is misleading; AUC/PR metrics and thresholding are essential.
- **Age** Distribution remains approximately normal, centered around age 50 - 55. Most applicants are between 30 and 70 years old, with fewer very young or elderly individuals.
- **Age vs. risk:** Default rates are **highest in younger groups (18‚Äì29)** and steadily decline with age, reflecting income stability and credit maturity.  
- **Income and utilization:** High revolving utilization and low income remain the strongest indicators of financial distress.  
- **Debt ratio:** Non-linear relationship; risk peaks around moderate ratios (1‚Äì2) before tapering.  
- **Delinquency patterns:** Multiple past delinquencies sharply increase default probability.

### Feature Engineering
- Added delinquency-derived variable (`TotalDelinquencies`)
- Derived income stability indicator (`DependentsPerIncome`)

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using multiple metrics to capture both discrimination and balance performance.  
Given the **high class imbalance** (only ~6.7% defaults), precision and recall are more informative than accuracy alone.

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1 | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|--------|------------|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Random Forest (CV)** | 0.615688 | 0.144719 | 0.233992 | 0.936533 | 0.862698 |
| **Random Forest (Test)** | 0.619932 | 0.147330 | 0.238080 | 0.937105 | 0.860421 |
| **XGBoost (CV)** | 0.601807 | 0.166800 | 0.260878 | 0.936676 | **0.864169** |
| **XGBoost (Test)** | 0.614815 | 0.166600 | **0.262160** | **0.937453** | 0.862600 |

<Figure size 1200x800 with 4 Axes><img width="1088" height="790" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0825eb42-562c-45c4-8907-f97f288fb50f" />

**AUC-ROC & PR-AUC**

- XGBoost achieved a slightly higher ROC-AUC (0.863) compared to Random Forest (0.860), indicating stronger overall ranking ability.
- The Precision‚ÄìRecall AUC (0.405 vs 0.398) also favors XGBoost, confirming better performance on the imbalanced target (defaults).
  
**Recall & F1-score**
  
- XGBoost captures more true defaulters (recall = 0.167) than Random Forest (recall = 0.147), while maintaining a similar precision.
- This leads to a higher F1-score, meaning XGBoost provides a better balance between precision and recall.
  
**Accuracy**
  
- Accuracy remains similar across models (~93.7%), but in imbalanced problems, accuracy is less meaningful than AUC or recall.

### Feature Importance ‚Äî XGBoost Champion Model

**Top Predictive Features (from the chart)**
| Rank | Feature                              | What it signals                                                                 |
|-----:|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `TotalDelinquencies`                 | Aggregated delinquency; strongest indicator of repayment risk.        |   
| 2    | `RevolvingUtilization_cleaned`       | Credit utilisation; High credit usage is a powerful distress indicator.  |
| 3    | `age_imputed`                        | Younger borrowers show higher default probability (stability/maturity effect).   |
| 4    | `NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines_cleaned` | Exposure to long-term secured credit; higher counts can raise obligations.     |
| 5    | `NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans_cleaned` | Indicates credit exposure, moderate levels are safer.                           |
| 6    | `DebtRatio_cleaned`                  | High ratios indicate leveraged households and repayment strain.               |
| 7    | `Missing_MonthlyIncome_Imputed`      | Income signal (and missingness) correlated with affordability risk.             |
| 8    | `DependentsPerIncome`                | Higher dependents often correlate with tighter household budgets.     |
| 9    | `NumberOfDependentsMissing_cleaned`  | Small contribution; weak signal compared to behaviour variables.                |

**Interpretation**
- **TotalDelinquencies** is the strongest feature it captures borrower past default history directly.
- **RevolvingUtilization_cleaned** is stong it shows how much revolving credit is being used; key in credit risk.
- **Portfolio actionables**: monitor customers with high `TotalDelinquencies` and **very high utilisation** for early-warning and capacity-building interventions.

### Key Takeaways

- **XGBoost** selected as the final production model due to stronger AUC and recall performance.  
- High accuracy reflects class imbalance, so **ROC-AUC and PR-AUC** were prioritized for model selection.  
- The model provides strong predictive separation between **low-risk** and **high-risk** applicants, supporting fairer and more data-driven lending decisions.
